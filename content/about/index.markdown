Hi there, you found my site! I'm Damian from Yorkshire, living in Preston and working with Linux stuff.

In my spare time I like to listen to music, learn new technologies and help out at a local (ish) scout group. I'm a big fan of free and open-source software, mainly Linux based software. I surround myself in open-source and have a passion for building scalable, reliable solutions which are capable of providing a high level of service to clients.

My skill set ranges from development to solution design and system administration, I am very much a person who will learn a technology as it is needed for at task (or just because it looks awesome) so my skills are dotted about somewhat. To get a better idea of my experiences have a look at my [cv](https://github.com/DamianZaremba/cv).
