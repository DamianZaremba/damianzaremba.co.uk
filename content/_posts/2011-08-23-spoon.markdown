It still needs some work to smooth out the handle and round the top off as well as sanding the dip out but I've made a pretty decent start on a spoon.

This started out as part of a tree trunk which got removed and split with an axe, from there all the work has been done with 3 knives:

* Spoon knife - for rounding the handle and scraping out the dip
* 9" knife - for taking off the thick outer and bark
* Gerber STL 2.5 knife - for taking tiny slivers off the handle and smoothing out some of the head

Here are some "early" (4/5 days of on and off work) pictures...
