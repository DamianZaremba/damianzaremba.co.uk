To check if a CVE has been patched on a RHEL based system perform the following.

First, get the real package name:
{% highlight bash %}
rpm -qa | grep <package>
{% endhighlight %}

Now check the package change log for CVE patches:
{% highlight bash %}
rpm -q <package> --changelog | grep <cve number>
{% endhighlight %}
