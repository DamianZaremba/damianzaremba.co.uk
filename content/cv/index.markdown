Employment History
-------------
### Sub 6 Limited - Lead Systems Administrator
*Oct 2011 - Aug 2012*

My primary responsibilities at Sub 6 where around leading the sysadmin side of the company.

This involved handling escalated issues, reacting to alerts, developing new products/features, automating parts of the infrastructure, building platforms for clients, managing the switched network and a wide verity of other things.

On the network side of things, I implemented a new layer 2 network for the primary datacenter, handled VLAN merging, trunk configurations, RADIUS/RANCID integration and SNMP based monitoring.

Looking more at the sysadmin side of things, I implemented a much more reliable monitoring solution based on Nagios and Graphite, automated a large number of internal tasks, developed new security features, implemented maintenance/password policies/procedures and revamped the PBX/DNS systems.

A few products/features that come to mind include;

* FTP Enforcer - per user IP restrictions for FTP access on shared hosts
* PHP Version Manager - PHP 5.2/5.3/5.4 "dual stack" for cPanel servers
* Gatekeeper - A Nginx based "gatekeeper" used when migrating hardware between datacenters so clients could have a custom maintenance page.
* MagentoClusterAdmin - A Django based web/API based management interface with Perl scripts to handle updating HAProxy/Pound/Nginx/GlusterFS configurations for a Magento web cluster.
* Speedyweb - Varnish integration for cPanel to allow automatic updating of rules on new account/IP creation

### Freelance Linux Systems Administrator
*Nov 2010 – Oct 2011*

During this time I worked for a number of clients, including managed solution provides, SMBs and end users.

This involved managing RHCS based setups running Tomcat for large media companies to handling account migrations, scripting automation and fixing general issues/reaction to monitoring alerts.

I worked an on-call style rotation handling issues as they where escalated up from the NOC after detection though NimBUS/Nagios. This included scripting some extra checks to catch more "edge cases" in the application until the developers could deploy a patched version.

### UKFast - Linux Engineer
*Feb 2010 – Oct 2010*

During my time at UKFast my main responsibilities where to provide user support, assist with pre-sales, perform server setups and maintain SLAs.

On a daily basis I was working with solutions ranging from bespoke shared hosting platforms to multi site geo-graphically redundant solutions featuring file and database replication.

The work ranged from installing and upgrading software to performing disaster recovery and investigating and resolving faults with applications. This could range from troubleshooting a segfaulting binary to recovering a down server.

I also had to deal with out of hours network and power issues on a datacenter wide scale and during periods of my rota I was solely responsible for resolving alerts as they were triggered and maintaining SLA levels.

### NYCC - Desk side support
*Oct 2008 – March 2009*

My main responsibilities at NYCC where around providing 4th line "on site" support to end users. This ranged from debugging software issues, deploying new hardware, doing in-place upgrades etc.

I also assisted in writing multiple scripts to automate the job system - this mainly revolved around the 'sign off' form system turning it from having to enter serial numbers for up to 40 devices manually per job to having it automatically propagate out of the database. 

In order to provide hardware support to the network team, I was also involved with the rollout of 100mbps fiber to public sites (libraries/schools etc) - this involved large scale changes around IP addresses, cable runs, configuration of VPN endpoints, fiber testing and a partial datacenter upgrade.

Education
-------------
### Firebrand Training
*2010*

I completed a number of courses at Firebrand to expand my knowledge on computer security and hardware fundamentals.

This resulted in my gaining Comptia A+, CEH and LPIC level 1/2 certifications.

### Rossendale School
*2002 - 2009*

I completed GCSEs in ICT (A), Mathematics (D) and key skills exams.

In my spare time I also assisted in the network administration, involving a single windows server 2003 DC, two Linux servers and around 50-70 desktops running a mix of windows 2000 and XP pro.

This involved me writing numerous scripts (bat/vbs) to do simple actions such as mapping drives or configuring proxies via group policy.
