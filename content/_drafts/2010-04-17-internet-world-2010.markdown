As some of you who are in the hosting industry probably know it is Internet world day in 9days, for those who don't know what Internet world is it is basically a massive annual social event for digital marketing and on-line businesses. I was looking forward to attending it as I would love to see some of the exhibitions however because I started the most amazing job at [UKFast](http://UKFast.co.uk) only 2months ago and already have this next week booked off for the LPI based course I signed up and paid for before starting I feel it is inappropriate to ask for the time off. So for anyone that can manage to go please let me know how it was! Hopefully I will be able to attend it next year but sadly this is probably going to be one of my first goals that I have to say is failed and needs re-attempting.

Also if you are going make sure you go check out [UKFast's](http://ukfast.co.uk/) stand, I hear we have some [fun stuff](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfiEwqu8r3w) going up![
