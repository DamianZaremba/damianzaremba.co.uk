A few people that are close have seen and know what motivates me to work but most don't, this is why I'm very 'fussy' about who I work for and what I do in my life.

**My Goal**

I set my goal in October last year, I was fed up of seeing all the bad sides to live and decided to change mine because you can do whatever you want no matter how hard it is as long as you try.

My goal is to build a reputation as one of the best infrastructure engineers in the UK and to be working as a senior infrastructure engineer before I'm 20.

Now some people might see this as impossible but I believe I can achieve it no matter what people throw at me. So far in the last 3 months I have gained multiple qualifications and got a job at the outstanding hosting company [UKFast](http://ukfast.net).

Now you could argue that I could of already had a job and yes I could but not the one I wanted. I have always believed that if your going to offer a service then you should be offering the best service you possible can plus more, this idea is sadly missing in a lot of companies. I don't believe in working for money but working for a cause that you believe in.

I set my personal goals so high but still attempt to break them because I have a desire to win and be successful. Many people just do the bear minimum and get by but there is little point in that, you need to make the most of your life.

Now while I have a massive main goal I also have many small goals from things like getting fitter to trying things I've never done before.

**My Values**

Now my values are tied to the goals I set in quite a tight way. These are what I live my life by and everything I do is based around them.

Many people have called me things from arrogant and selfish to intelligent and hard working. The thing is they are probably all right because I refuse to let people stand in the way of letting me reach my goal and I will generally tell them exactly what I think of them.

Now of course this has to be appropriate and measured otherwise you start to become someone that you are not while trying to reach your goal.

An interesting point came up today at [UKFast](http://ukfast.net), we were all sat around the conference room talking about motivation and were asked who could see themselves as a future director of the company, everyone apart from me raised there hands. Now I'll explain why because I have nothing against the company and would love to be in a position where I could make decisions that would directly influence the company future.

I however have no desire to manage people because I don't believe currently I have enough skills in that area to make a decent job of it. I would in fact love to be 'in charge' of a technical part and grow the company from a tech point of view but I don't want to have to make decisions that affect other peoples lives.

I hope to get the opportunities that let me achieve my goal, so far I have done and I am nearer to being successful. I find [Lawrence](http://www.lawrencejones.eu/) quite an inspiration for making the impossible happen and hope I can contribute to building the company and become a major part of it in the next few years to break his extraordinary goals.

Put simply, I have had the best month of my life but I know next month is going to be much much better.
