So I thought maybe a quick update was due as I haven't actually had any entries (or finished the admin pages) since I pushed my custom site out.

As some of you may already know I recently applied to [UKFast](http://ukfast.net), after a couple of interviews (and phone calls) they offered me a job! Today was my first day working there and I feel like I am going to fit into the company and really enjoy working there once I get more hands on.

As with any good news there is always some sadder news, as I now have a full time job with for the first time the prospect of keeping it for a long time a few things are going to happen;

1) I have parted ways from Xinos, I do not want to say I quit really.. I know I did on [twitter](http://twitter.com/DamianZaremba) earlier this week but honestly I don't think you could quit something like that.

For those who don't know what Xinos is or my relation to it, we are basically a company aiming to offer the best free service in the hosting industry with the support level of enterprise hosting. 

2) I am no longer freelancing in programming and system development

3) Once I close the last few projects I have open I will be taking on no more. I currently have a lot of uni work to do as well as working and finding time to work on my personal project so sadly will be accepting no more.

4) I won't be freely available to help people out, this includes things like helping out at the Scout group near me etc

Whilst a lot of closing my past ventures and activities makes me pretty sad I feel that there are some very good things to come, every time I walk into the UKFast office I just get this totally vibe of people doing what they love. I'm not really sure how to describe it but they seem to be a company that is very about you as a person, for example there was 2/3 people sat in the induction/training stuff we all do that don't actually know what there job role will be just that they are right for the company.

I really believe that they are a deserving company, every single person I've spoken too is just amazing and so dedicated to our company and providing the best service to the clients. I have never felt it any where else but it feels like I belong there. It probably sounds really stupid but I'm sure if you have ever worked/interviewed for them you know what I mean.

I feel that as I am starting a new chapter in my life I am going to leave the past and set goals for my future, I know what I want to do but sometimes I just don't have the confidence in myself to do it but I think working for UKFast will help me to meet my own goals.

I currently would like to be much fitter than I am, I ideally would like to be able to cycle/run into work and participate in climbing/kayaking/hiking/camping more often with friends. I would also like to make some new friends and meet new people to help me not be as shy as I am. I should probably go out more and not be so isolated from everyone then I feel I would be a happier more successful person.

I hope to remember to update this site more often but we shall see about that....
