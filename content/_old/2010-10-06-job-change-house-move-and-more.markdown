So yeah it's been a busy few months. I've finished my new server setup, ready to move mail onto it. Moved flats. Made loads of progress in a project and got let go from a job.

I moved from Bury to Manchester a month ago, it's strange living in the city it's like the world never sleeps. Currently still have a messy flat as I haven't completely un-packed but things are getting there. Hopefully won't have to move any time soon as the last time was a bit of a nightmare. Moving into the center might help improve my current non existent social life or maybe just give me reason to be in an office 24/7 working (tbc). In other news the 7th A Rochdale scout groups website had a bunch of issues completed over the last few weeks, once the images are all done and I can write the actual text content then we should be good to get it online and hopefully expand the group even further! Shame I'm not the best designer but I should be able to do a better job than the current "made in word" version ;)

As well as all the fun times had recently I've also got a bit of a change work wise, after being "let go" from my current job at UKFast I've decided to try and find a small passionate company where I can really have an impact and do what I enjoy. Unfortunately the job I did have wasn't right for me as there was little room for diversity within the role or change.

Currently I'm looking for a passionate small/start-up company where I can utilize my current skills, learn a lot and dedicate my time to making a difference.

Thanks to everyone at UKFast for the fun times, advise and support. Maybe one day we will work together once again.
