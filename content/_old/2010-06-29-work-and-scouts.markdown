Many of you probably don't know but I am actually a member of the scout association and enjoy helping out at my "local" scout group. It is not really local group anymore as I went from living in Rossendale to Yorkshire and now Bury and 7th A is in Rochdale but I travel the extra distance because it is where my scouting history is.

Now up until 6months ago I attended regularly and would be available at most times to help out that was until I started at UKFast now as with all new jobs I let it slide that I couldn't make it down to 7th A twice a week but I feel now is the time to get back into it. With the rota I'm currently on I can get down for a couple of weeks (I currently work 4days on 4days off) but when I switch back to the usual rota this wouldn't be possible. Hopefully I can arrange to finish earlier on wed/thurs and work extra hours but that's up to my boss. I'm sure he will understand and maybe say yes!

So what's been happening recently?
Well I'm still working on there new site (yes still.. sorry) it's proving quite a challenge as I don't know 100% what platform they have at there web host, I have so many ideas but can't guarantee that there will be access to such basic things as a database (Not that this is a massive problem as I could just host a db for there site if really needed, I happen to work in hosting and have a bunch of servers sat doing nothing :-)). Currently it will be pretty much a static site but some things I'd like to implement (totally not even discussed, this is the first time they have come out of my head):



    
  * Monthly/Bi-Monthly newsletter that parents/friends can sign up to from the website - Manageable though an admin interface - Yeah I'd need a db for that :(

    
  * New stream on the website - Manageable though an admin interface - I'll need a db for that

    
  * Ideas/feedback form for website/group

    
  * Some interactive tour stuff of HQ

    
  * "Meet the leaders" page - Manageable though an admin interface - Yeah I'd need a db for that as well


Loads of other stuff as well just all depends on how flexible the hosting is tbh, should have the site finished by the end of the month to a basic level though!

Other ideas I have include writing a decent management system for groups.

Slightly dull post, more fun things to come soon though I hope!
